# In regular mode, this script searches the reserves table for all holds where 
# the priorities are damaged, i.e. there exists a priority number greater than 
# the total number of holds for that biblio.  In Aggressive mode, all holds are 
# selected.  For each selected biblio, all the holds are reprioritized first by 
# reservedate, then the existing priority number.  It is fully possible this may
# be counter to the intent of priority list; the user is warned.
